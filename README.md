## Local Setup

> [!NOTE]
> This project uses [uv](https://docs.astral.sh/uv/) as the python venv and package manager

To **install** the virtual enviroment with all of the packages needed, run:
```
uv install
```

> [!IMPORTANT]
> We recommend to use [Visual Studio Code](https://code.visualstudio.com) with the [Jupyter Notebooks](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=ms-toolsai.jupyter) extension

When using VSCode open the [simulation.ipynb]("./simulation.ipynb") file and press ***run all*** to get the results.

There is also an option to run the jupyter notebook in the browser with this command:
```
uv run --with jupyter jupyter lab
```
